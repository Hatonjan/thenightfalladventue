***The Nightfall Adventure***
The journey to return the light to the world.

**Project description:**
The Nightfall Adventure is a video game developed as part of the Introduction to Programming class. It is intended to be both fun and challenging for the user. I have implemented everything I have learned in the class and a little extra to make it more visually appealing, such as the rotating collectables. That was a challenge, but I was able to complete what I had in mind.

**Controls**
`a` Moves to the left
`d` Moves to the right
`w` Jumps

*I include a fighting mode to allow the game character to interact with enemies*
`Arrow left` Activates fighting mode to the left
`Arrow right` Activates fighting mode to the right
`Arrow left` + `a` Strike to the left
`Arrow right` + `d` Strike to the right

** Microsoft Copilot AI **
-I use Microsoft Copilot AI to supplement my learning process while working on my game project, verifying every 
 piece of information independently. Not a single line of this code was copied and pasted from any AI model.
 *Examples:
-I'm working with javascript and the p5.js library and I have this error in the console. "Uncaught ReferenceError: X is not defined"
 what can I do to correct the error?
-Is this the correct syntax for an if statement?
-I'm working with JavaScript and the p5.js library in my video game project, and I make my collectable rotate 
 but rotate too fast. How can I make it rotate slower?
